# Burgers-Eqn-Simulator

This is a 2D simulator for Burger's Equation. Specifically, it simulates a square cross-section of an engine filled with gas which undergoes velocity disturbance due to the injection of a small amount of gas in the nozzle.
Finite differences are used to approximate the differential equation and evolve the solution in time.
